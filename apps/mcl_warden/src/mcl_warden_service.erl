%% @doc The mcl_om service contract: what this service is and may do.
%%
%% SIX CALLBACKS, ALL REQUIRED. mcl_om resolves them BY NAME at startup, on a
%% live node, so a service that forgets one dies with `undef' where nobody is
%% watching. The `-behaviour' attribute below is what turns that into a compile
%% error instead, and the generated test suite guards the attribute itself.
%%
%% IT ANNOUNCES NOTHING AND ASKS FOR NOTHING, on purpose. A service that does
%% nothing yet has no capability to offer and needs no authority from the realm.
%% Advertising a capability before it exists puts a lie on the mesh that another
%% service can find and call. Both lists grow when the thing they name exists,
%% and a generated test fails when they change, so growing them is a deliberate
%% act rather than a comment someone forgot.

%% WHAT THIS SERVICE ANNOUNCES IT CAN DO. Other services find this one by these
%% names, so each entry is a promise that something answers.
capabilities() -> [].

%% THE AUTHORITY THIS SERVICE ASKS THE REALM FOR, and deliberately nothing more.
%% Ask for exactly the topics you publish and subscribe to. Popped, an attacker
%% gains precisely this and no more, which is the whole point of listing it.
%%
%% The scope is claimed now because it is the namespace every later resource
%% hangs under, and a scope costs nothing while a rename costs every deployed
%% peer.
