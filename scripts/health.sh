# /health is served on a Unix socket inside the container (/run/mcl/health.sock),
# so the question goes through the container engine. Pass a container name
# when it is not the default, and set ENGINE=podman on a podman box:
#
#   scripts/health.sh
#   ENGINE=podman scripts/health.sh mcl-warden
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, because they need different responses from whoever is
# reading. Unreachable means the container is not running or the socket is not
# there yet. Unhealthy means the node is up and telling you something is wrong
# with it, and mcl_om answers that with a 503 carrying a reason. Collapsing the
# two sends you to look in the wrong place.
#
#   0  healthy
#   1  reachable, reports degraded or down
#   2  unreachable
